**COLLEGE:** M.V.G.R college of engineering<br>

## MY PROJECT

**IoT on AUTOMOBILE** 

For providing real time assistance, one should continuously collect data and feed it to the designed model and analyze whether the obtained attributes are within the limits and predict its failure. From the obtained data one can continuously monitor the vehicle conditions through visualization and prevent it from failures with the help of digital twin.<br>

**METHODOLOGY:**<br>
- [x] Identification of sample part(roll-cage)

- [x] Modeling of the part

- [x] Analysis of the part with theoretical or assumed loading condition

- [x] Selection of suitable sensors and attributes of measurement in sampling

- [ ] Integration of sensors to the part

- [ ] Collecting the data by developing IOT module and interfacing with the model and analyzing with obtained data

- [ ] Comparing the results to create a digital twin

- [ ] Creating a virtual model which continuously obtain data from the cloud and continuously show the influence of the attributes on the model.

- [ ] If possible development of an app to visualize the condition of the vehicle
